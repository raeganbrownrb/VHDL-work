# VHDL-work
This project calls for the design of a Digital Clock using the FPGA board, a keypad, and the VGA display. 
The Digital Clock will operate in two main modes, time, which will display in minutes and stopwatch, which will increment in seconds. 
The keypad is responsible for changing the modes and manipulating the time display while in those modes. 
The VGA display presents the current time or stopwatch value. 
If button 1 is pressed on the keypad, the user can determine which mode that the clock is in.
When the button is pressed, the clock will alternate to the other mode, between stopwatch and time.
When in stopwatch mode, the stopwatch will keep track of how much time has passed. 
Button 2 can start or stop the stopwatch at each button press, while button 3 resets the stopwatch. 
The user can change the clock time by pressing button 4 and entering clock-setup mode. 
While in this mode, the user can use the buttons on the keypad to change the clock time.
